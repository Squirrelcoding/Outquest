# OutQuest ðŸŒŽ

Outquest is focused on helping users with anxiety cope with it by encouraging them to go outside and engage with their local communities by creating fun daily quests and challenges to complete! For example, one quest could be to find a white squirrel. The user is required to go outside and explore their surroundings to find one, take a picture, and upload it to Outquest. An AI judge is then used to evaluate the user's submission. There are also other modes of submitting images, such as entering codes and visiting locations (work in progress).

Furthermore, users can create event-style quests where many people can participate at the same time, climbing leaderboards in real-time, and engage with each other in a live chat. 

Users can also form groups and leaderboards to hold each other accountable. Badges for streaks and being the first to complete an event-style quest are also awarded to encourage people to keep going!

This app is being submitted to the Congressional App Challenge.

## Features

### Modes

Outquest comes with many modes for all sorts of quests.

- Generic scavenger hunt: You describe the criteria for a photo and users must go outside to find objects matching the same criteria. For example, if the criteria is "three white squirrels" then users must upload three distinct photos of white squirrels that they find outisde.

- (In development ðŸ’») Location mode: The user needs to be physically present at a location to mark a quest as complete.

- (In development ðŸ’») QR Code: Generate some QR codes in the app, print them out, and hide them in the real world for users to scan! 

- (In development ðŸ’») Path tracker: Users must trace out a path on a map to complete the quest.

### Leaderboards
You can create many different types of leaderboards and scoring options for whatever you need.

- Private leaderboard
- (In development ðŸ’») Organizational leaderboard: Only people with an organizational email address can sign up and participate.

### Prizes

Whenever a user completes a quest, you can configure your quest to send them an email with prizes, such as gift card codes!
