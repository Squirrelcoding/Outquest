# OutQuest ðŸŒŽ

OutQuest is an app where you can complete and create quests in your local area! Think of it as a more accessible version of Geocaching, where users hide objects called _*geocaches*_ in specific locations, and others are tasked with finding them.

But in Outquest, you don't need to buy geocaches or trek deep into the woods. All you need is your phone! Simply create an account and get started by browsing local quests to complete. These quests can vary in their goal and difficulty.

Some of them are as simple as taking a picture of a red car outside, while others involve scanning QR codes at an event or completing timed scavenger hunts with prizes.

This app is being submitted to the Congressional App Challenge.

## Features

### Modes

Outquest comes with many modes for all sorts of quests.

- Generic scavenger hunt: You describe the criteria for a photo and users must go outside to find objects matching the same criteria. For example, if the criteria is "three white squirrels" then users must upload three distinct photos of white squirrels that they find outisde.

- (In development ðŸ’») Location mode: The user needs to be physically present at a location to mark a quest as complete.

- (In development ðŸ’») QR Code: Generate some QR codes in the app, print them out, and hide them in the real world for users to scan! 

- (In development ðŸ’») Path tracker: Users must trace out a path on a map to complete the quest.

### Leaderboards
You can create many different types of leaderboards and scoring options for whatever you need.

- Private leaderboard
- (In development ðŸ’») Organizational leaderboard: Only people with an organizational email address can sign up and participate.

### Prizes

Whenever a user completes a quest, you can configure your quest to send them an email with prizes, such as gift card codes!
